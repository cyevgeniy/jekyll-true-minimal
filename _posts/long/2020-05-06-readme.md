Some considerations when using this website design:

Due to the way the jekyll or kramdown works/wraps images, it seems the only way to achieve the correct image-centered post style is to manually include and enclose them like this within the post:

    {:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
    ![Hover text.](/assets/img/yourimage.jpg)
    {}: refdef}


Another consideration for this site to work as intended is that you need to set the page title (in front matter) of short posts to be the date, manually. You could use any naming convention you like really, but the distinction between the two core categories is that short posts are meant for journal style writings where it would be more meaningful to delineate by date rather than a title. You see?
